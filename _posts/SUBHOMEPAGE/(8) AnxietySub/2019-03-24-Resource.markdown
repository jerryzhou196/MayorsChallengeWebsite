Everybody feels tense, worried or nervous from time to time. This is anxiety. It is a natural response to stress. The experience of anxiety is very individual. Some situations may create more anxiety than others and everybody copes with anxiety differently.

In small doses, anxiety can be a good thing. Anxiety can motivate us and make us more productive. A little bit of fear may push us to study harder for that next exam or prepare for that job interview. And a burst of anxiety can even be a lifesaver when it helps us get out of the way of danger.

But too much anxiety can be a problem. If feelings of tension, fear and worry are there too much of the time and get in the way of everyday activities, it could be the sign of an anxiety disorder. Like depression, anxiety disorders are a common problem. In fact, sometimes depression and anxiety occur together.
